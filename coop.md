Dear Co-op Students of the Year Award Committee,

<br/>

The following is my personal statement for my application for the 2017 Co-op Students of the Year award. Key reasons why I believe I should win the Co-op Students of the Year award is my history of outstanding co-op evaluation, the AppOverflow project which completely changes the way information is shared at PointClickCare and my extensive contributions to co-op and community involvement.

<br/>

**Evaluations from other co-op terms**

I have consistently been praised for my unique contributions and exceptional performance in all of my co-op terms thus far. My first co-op position was at the company Kenna. There, I was a Web Application Developer where I developed their web application which displays a large and complex amount of data to farmers. I was given a co-op evaluation of outstanding due to my superior performance on the job. At PointClickCare, I was a Front-End UI Developer and had the opportunity to enforce coding standards in an industry leading electronic health record application and spearhead a project from start-to-finish. I was also given an evaluation of outstanding for my exceptional work in this project. Currently, I am working at Shopify as a Front-End Developer and I am on track to receiving an evaluation of excellent or outstanding.

**Contribution to employer**

My contributions to PointClickCare as a Front-End UI Developer truly went above and beyond what was expected of me and made a tremendous impact on the company and co-op program. I am consistently praised for my extensive product and user experience oriented way of thinking. I performed all my duties stated in the job description with a high degree of reliability and instilled trust and confidence in all stakeholders. In addition to performing my key responsibilities for developing cutting edge user interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Java and JSP while maintaining coding and UI/UX standards in the application, I went above and beyond in the AppOverflow project. With such a fast-growing company like PointClickCare there are unique challenges they face regarding knowledge management and information access between employees. AppOverflow was designed to be a destination similar to Stack Overflow but will be used for internal questions and purposes. With this project, I was required to learn and work on new technologies like PHP and MySQL which have not been used a PointClickCare before. I also went above and beyond the call of duty by completely customising all aspects of the site to suit PointClickCareâ€™s needs. This included stringent security requirements, code syntax highlighting, reporting functionality, categorisation, gamification and newsletters. My strong desire to go above and beyond with this
