**Academic achievements**

I do not currently meet the 75 per cent overall average but I’m doing my best to boost my grades. Since this is an award for co-operative education and not academic achievement I hope that it will be taken into consideration accordingly.

<br/>

**Contribution to co-op**

I am a huge proponent of the co-operative education program here at the University of Waterloo. At PointClickCare I signed up as a member of the Social Committee, which helps to plan events for co-op students to bond and socialize. I also volunteered to talk at PointClickCare’s co-op open house where I discussed my role as a co-op student to prospective co-op students. The major project I was involved with at PointClickCare, AppOverflow is an interactive knowledge management platform. This project was developed with co-op students in mind as we often need a little more guidance and have the least amount of context. The AppOverflow project would benefit any co-op student immensely and is something I wish could be implemented at every co-op employer.  I enjoy helping other co-op students however I can such as by providing career advice, offering to critique resumes, and editing work term reports. I also make myself available to answer questions on social media, helping prospective students and classmates who are looking for advice. I volunteered to speak about the university, my program and co-op at the Ontario University Fair. Currently at Shopify, I have volunteered to help host the intern lightning talks which are presentations that give an outlet for co-op students to talk about whatever they want and get to know more about other students/roles. 

<br/>

**Volunteer or community involvement**

I enjoy playing an active role in my community and I achieve this through volunteering. At the University, I volunteered to speak in recruiting events such as at the Ontario University Fair, clubs which promote social entrepreneurship such as Enactus UW and I have volunteered as a mentor at campus events such as Hack the North, a hackathon in which students are given resources and a weekend to create something. Outside of the university I volunteered at a not-for-profit called Founders Canada, aimed at providing resources and content for aspiring entrepreneurs. While building AppOverflow at PointClickCare, I contributed some of the plugins I developed to the open source community in order for other developers to use. I also volunteer extensively at my local community centre in Mississauga, my home city. I have received a Volunteer Service Award from the Government of Ontario, Alumni@Nortel Scholarship, Rick Hansen Secondary S.T.O.R.M. (Stewardship, Technology, Opportunity, Responsiveness and Metacurriculum) Award and a MiWay Driving Force Leadership award for my extensive contributions to the community through volunteering.
